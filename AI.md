- Used ChatGPT to refactor code to follow SLAP principles for Event constructor and FixedDurationTask constructor
  - ChatGPT was able to effectively divide the large constructor into multiple functions. The variables used are adequately named and JavaDoc comments were also added to newly created functions. This is likely due to the focus on good coding practices, as per the request to refactor to suit SLAP principles. 
  - However, the extracted functions occassionally did not fully replicate the functionality of the original function, such as the case splits. Generated code should be checked before being committed.
